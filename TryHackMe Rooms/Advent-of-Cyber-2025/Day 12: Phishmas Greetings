Key Learnings

Attackers usually want:
Credentials (remember McCann Institute’s Code Red campaign?).
Drop malware.
Steal data.
Straight-up money.

Classic red flags: impersonation, fake urgency, side-channel weirdness, obvious malicious intent.
Fancier stuff: typosquatting, punycode homoglyphs (I swear I read it as “bunycode” at first — thank you dyslexia + Christmas theme brain).
A little OSINT goes a long way in making these super targeted.
True story: Had a coworker once say, “Why would I need to learn this? I’m too dumb for hackers to bother with me.”
I bit my tongue so hard. Bro… that’s exactly why they’d target you.

Final Thoughts
Super practical room. Everyone should do something like this.

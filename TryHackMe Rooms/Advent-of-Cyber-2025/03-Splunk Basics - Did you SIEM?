# Day 3 – Splunk Fundamentals (My Villain Origin Story)

This was my literal first time ever touching Splunk in my life.  
It took exactly 30 minutes for me to start planning crimes against this language.

Within 30 minutes I had already:
- Yelled at my screen (out loud, neighbors probably heard)
- Briefly considered becoming a professional fisherman instead
- Started mentally designing not one, but TWO Python projects to never deal with this again

**Side rant #1 – The <redacted> bullshit**  
The room makes you copy some IP, then replace`<redacted>` with IP in the next question.  
Cool concept… except I’m jumping between like six different browser tabs, the Splunk instance, the task window, my notes, etc.  
Every single time I had to manually delete the real `<redacted>` and type IP I died a little inside.  

So of course my frustrated brain went:  
“If I have to do this in a real job I’m writing a 5-line Python script that just globally replaces `<redacted>` with whatever IP I have in my clipboard. Fight me.”

**Side rant #2 – The eventual rebellion**  
By the end of the room I already decided I’m building a full Python wrapper called either:
- `fuck-spl`
- `splunk-therapy`
- `splunk-but-make-it-not-hurt`

So I can write actual readable code like:
```python
logs.where(process="mcgreedy").where(dest_ip=evil_ip).show()

Day 13: YARA Rules (YARA = Yet Another Recursive Acronym — love it)
Overview

Writing and using YARA rules to hunt malware.

Key Learnings

Used for:
Post-incident forensics.
Proactive threat hunting.
Intelligence-driven scans.
Memory analysis.

Rules look for strings, hex patterns, and conditions.

Challenges & Reflections

This one kicked my butt — had to lean on the walkthrough for parts.
At least my prior nano experience made editing the rule file less scary.

Final Thoughts
YARA is powerful but not clicking for me yet. Definitely needs more practice

Day 10: SOC Alert Triage
Overview

Why alert triage and prioritization actually matter.
Poke around in Microsoft Sentinel to review and analyze alerts.
Correlate logs to figure out what’s real and assign verdicts.

Key Learnings

Triage is everything in a SOC — separating real threats from endless noise.
In my day job with SCADA, half the alarms are dumb: a tank level we don’t even control going off, or an eyewash station triggering because it’s raining (thanks, moisture sensors). We live and die by filtering the important ones.

Challenges & Reflections

This room fought me hard. No matter what I did, the right Sentinel logs refused to show up.
Might be a skill issue on my end, but I hit peak frustration and just watched the walkthrough so I wouldn’t stall out completely.
Side note: I now officially have beef with the task bot.

Final Thoughts
Even without hands-on Sentinel, the concepts hit home — basically what I do every day with industrial alarms.

Day 14: Containers - DoorDasher Demise
Overview

How containers and Docker actually work.
Docker runtime basics.
Investigate a compromised container setup.

Key Learnings

Useful commands: docker ps, docker exec, whoami, cat, etc.
Container escapes and privilege escalation risks.

Challenges & Reflections

Hands-down my favorite day so far.
Finally started chipping away at the Docker intimidation I’ve carried all year.
Got thrown off by having to mess with port mapping in a way I’d never done before.
Once I saw familiar commands like whoami and cat (stuff I’ve practiced on my own), I relaxed and it clicked.

Final Thoughts
This room made containers feel way less mysterious. Huge confidence boost.

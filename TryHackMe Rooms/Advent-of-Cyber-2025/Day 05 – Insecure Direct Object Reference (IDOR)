## Day 5 – Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed (felt illegal the whole time)  
**Vulnerability type:** Classic IDOR – not SQLi  

### What the task told me to do
- Connected to the app ✓  
- Kept hammering `/api/parents/view_accountinfo?user_id=10` six times like a noob  

### Burp literally said:
> “Try modifying the user_id parameter to explore for potential IDOR vulnerabilities.”

### What I actually did next
- Changed `user_id=10` → `user_id=1` → `2` → `3` …  
- Suddenly looking at other parents’ accounts  
- Found the admin account (or the flag holder)  
- Flag get  

### Mind-blown moment #2
This is the exact same technique Moxie used on Apple’s intro badges:  
→ Look at a numeric identifier → increment it → profit.  
I just recreated a famous real-world hack in a browser tab.

### Current vibe
- The “I’m gonna break everything” feeling is still there… but it’s starting to feel like excitement instead of fear  
- Starting to trust the process: when something feels sketchy, that’s usually the right path  
- Burp basically held my hand and said “just change the number, dummy” – and it worked  


Keep clicking the scary thing.

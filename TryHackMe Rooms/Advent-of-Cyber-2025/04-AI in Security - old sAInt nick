# Day 4 – AI in Security: Old sAInt Nick (SQLi + AI = Chaos I Love)

Mood going in: "AI? In Advent of Cyber? Alright I’m listening"  
Mood coming out: Full gremlin mode, I would like to speak to the manager of reality

Hands-down the most fun I’ve had so far.

- I learned SQL injection way back in February but never actually got to actually USE it (because, you know… jail)
- Today I finally got to type `' OR 1=1--` in anger and it WORKED. dream achieved.
- The AI part felt completely natural; it was literally just chatting with a bot until it spilled the exact payload I needed
- Then we wrote a tiny Python script with nano… and bro, the workflow was EXACTLY what I did this morning to get pymodbus running on my Raspberry Pi Zero

Same vibes:  
nano something.py → python3 something.py → watch the magic happen  
Except this time the magic was stealing credentials instead of reading sensor data lol

I didn’t know I needed “weaponized ChatGPT + classic SQLi” in my life but now it’s all I want to do forever.

Day 4 is proof that cyber can be fun as hell when they let you actually break stuff (legally).

Christmas is saved, but my moral compass is now slightly bent.

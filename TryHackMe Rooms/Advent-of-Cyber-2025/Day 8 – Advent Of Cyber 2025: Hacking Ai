## 🎄 Day 8 – Advent of Cyber 2025 (TryHackMe)

### Topic

**Hacking AI – how AI systems can be manipulated, misled, or used against themselves.**

---

## 🎯 Overview

This room explored how AI systems can be attacked in ways that feel very similar to classic vulnerabilities (like SQL injection), but adapted to modern AI-driven workflows.

I use AI daily in both my personal and professional life, so this was especially interesting. Seeing how AI can be exploited — sometimes using its *own logic* — reinforced that AI is a tool, not magic.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. AI Can Be Attacked Like Any Other System

* AI systems still rely on:

  * Inputs
  * Context
  * Assumptions
* If those inputs are manipulated, the output can be manipulated

This felt very similar to:

* SQL injection
* Command injection
* Logic abuse vulnerabilities

Different surface, same core problem.

---

### 2. Prompt Manipulation / AI Abuse

* Carefully crafted input can:

  * Bypass intended restrictions
  * Change AI behavior
  * Extract unintended responses

This reinforces that **AI safety is not automatic** — it must be designed, tested, and monitored like any other system.

---

## ⚠️ Lab Issues Encountered

* The AttackBox experienced glitches during the lab
* After refreshing, the environment unexpectedly revealed the answer

Even though the solution was exposed early:

* I still completed the steps manually
* I treated it as a learning exercise rather than just checking the box

---

## 🧩 Takeaways

* AI can be exploited using familiar attacker mindsets
* Prompt-based attacks are a real-world concern
* Understanding *why* an AI responds a certain way is more important than memorizing tricks
* AI should be treated like any other system that accepts user input

---

## ✍️ Personal Reflection

Even with the lab hiccup, this was a fun and eye-opening room. It reinforced that AI isn’t replacing fundamentals — it’s **adding a new layer where the same old mistakes can still happen**.

---

## 🗒️ One-Line Summary (Future Me)

> Day 8 showed that AI can be attacked much like traditional systems — manipulate the input, manipulate the output — and that AI security is still just security.

Now THIS was my bread and butter. Modbus, register maps, coils, pymodbus scripting — literally the exact stuff I’ve been grinding in my home lab for months.
The room was fun, engaging, and honestly got me out of my own head about being nervous approaching my home setup. For the first time in Advent, I felt completely comfortable — no confusion, just “oh, I know this dance.” Funny as hell because I’ve been hesitant to push harder on my own lab, and here THM drops a room that’s basically “hey Joshua, you already speak this language.” Big confidence boost.

# Day 1 – Linux CLI - Shells Bells (Learning Objectives)

Mood going in: "It's literally Day 1, how hard can it be?"  
Mood coming out: Secretly impressed that a beginner room actually taught me stuff

Honestly? I walked in cocky because I’ve used Linux before…  
…then immediately forgot half the basic commands and had to Google “how to list hidden files again.”

## What actually stuck
- `grep` is still the goat, no notes in my brain forever
- `find` saved my life more than once
- Piping with `|` felt like cheating and I’m here for it
- Navigation was smoother than expected once I stopped overthinking

The little Christmas story was genuinely fun; felt like playing a detective game instead of “learning.”  
They somehow made `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` feel exciting. Respect.

## Real talk
Not much to rage about; room did exactly what it said on the tin.  
I just wish every beginner tutorial was this smooth instead of throwing you into man pages and telling you to suffer.

Day 1 complete. Christmas is (temporarily) saved.  
On to the next one whenever the free timer stops hating me.

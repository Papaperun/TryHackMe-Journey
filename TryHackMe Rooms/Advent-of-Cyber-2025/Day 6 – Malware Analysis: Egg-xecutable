# Advent of Cyber 2025 – Personal Log
*By: You (now a malware photographer)*

## Day 6 – Malware Analysis: Egg-xecutable  
**Status:** ✅ Completed – and actually really fun!  
**Vibe:** “Wait… I can just freeze malware in time like a crime scene photographer?”  

### What blew my mind
- Never knew tools like **ProcMon**, **Process Explorer**, **RegShot**, and **Strings** existed  
- Taking “before vs after” snapshots is literally what I already do IRL when rebuilding pumps or debugging Excel sheets  
  → I’ve been doing malware analysis at work for years without realizing it lol  

### Key tools I used today
- **RegShot** → snapshot registry before/after → instant diff of what the malware touched  
- **ProcMon** → watched it spawn `cmd.exe`, drop files, etc. like a security camera  
- **Strings** → pulled out all the readable text → found the flag hiding in plain sight  
- Bonus: Learned `.egg` files are just Python archives → `uncompyle6` or unzip → readable source  

### Favorite moment
Felt like finding the exact bolt that fell off a pump just by comparing photos.

### Real-life carryover
I already think in “before/after” photos at work.  
Now I have actual tools to do it on Windows malware. This is gonna make troubleshooting customer PCs way faster.

### Current feelings
- Screen size still sucks (tiny VM window problems) → gonna fix that with a bigger monitor soon  
- The “I’m gonna break something” fear is almost gone. Replacing it with “let me take a photo first”  
- Starting to see how all these rooms connect: SQLi → IDOR → now malware persistence → it’s not random, it’s a kill chain  


Keep snapping pics, keep breaking (safely).
